# ComplexSystemsSimulations

In this repository you can find problems of complex systems from the field 
of solid state and their results with the codes that produce them.

## Problems
***Random walks*** - In this set of problems, we explore the concept of the mean value of a random number generator from a uniform 
distribution. We examine the square of the displacement of a random walk from its initial position for a given number of steps 
in one and two dimensions, as well as the distribution of the displacement in one dimension. Additionally, we analyze the number 
of new places visited by a random walk with respect to the number of steps in one, two, and three dimensions. Finally, we consider 
the trapping time and the probability of survival of a random walk with traps.
