# Complex Systems Simulations

This repository contains problems related to complex systems in the field of solid-state physics, along with the corresponding results and the codes that produce them.

## Problems

### Random Walks
In this set of problems, we explore several aspects of random walks:
- **Mean Value of a Random Number Generator**: Examining the mean value of a random number generator from a uniform distribution.
- **Displacement in Random Walks**: Analyzing the square of the displacement from the initial position for a given number of steps in one and two dimensions, and the distribution of the displacement in one dimension.
- **New Places Visited**: Studying the number of new places visited by a random walk with respect to the number of steps in one, two, and three dimensions.
- **Trapping Time and Survival Probability**:  We calculate the trapping time and the probability of survival of a random walk with traps.

### Diffusion-Limited Aggregation
In this problem, we create the diffusion-limited aggregation fractal and calculate its dimension.

### Percolation
We construct and study the percolation problem.

### Networks
We create and study the three main types of networks:
- **Random Network**: Using the Erdős–Rényi model.
- **Small-World Network**: Using the Watts–Strogatz model.
- **Scale-Free Network**: Using the Barabási–Albert model.

### Neural Network
We construct a small library in Python that creates neural networks to solve the XOR problem.

### Correlation Matrix
Using stock data, we calculate the correlation matrix and the distance matrix.
